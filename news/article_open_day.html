					 <span class="first_ltr">I</span>I walked into Springland International School to primarily have a look at my son’s academic records and to get to interact with his teacher. Everything was done in a timely and organized manner. I knew my son’s class so I simply walked in. I was ushered into a seat and signed in to a record book. After this I was given a description of my son’s attitude towards activities in an out of the classroom, his strengths and weaknesses and was offered help to what I could also do to help at home. Later, I saw records of his written tasks and comments allocated. I spoke to his teacher about things I did not understand and wanted more information on.  Also,I took notice of the fact that the classrooms were rich with print and non-print learning materials and these were also organized. The general atmosphere in the class was welcoming.
					</p>

					<p class="story">	
					 I decided to read a little about open days on the net to keep myself abreast and to find out the educational implications behind this. I found out that open days are known elsewhere as open house. It is a time set in the academic year or term when the school together with all its departments and centers are open to the stakeholders; usually, the parents, guardians, PTA executives, and the general public who seek an interest in the school. That had been until recently when only those financially and socially involved in the school become participants. I think this exactly what the school delivered and I would like to commend them for that. I would also like to use thus as an avenue to sensitize parents and guardian to get involved in such fruitful school activities and most importantly to prioritize them.
					</p>

					<p class="story">	
					 All in all, it was an enlightening experience for me as a parent. I got the chance to have a fruitful interaction with my child’s teacher. I also got to see the learning environment of my child and how he interacts in school apart from the home.

						The SIS Open day was a good experience for both parents and teachers, an avenue to share ideas for the benefit of parents, teaches and the school community aat large.
