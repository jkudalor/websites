				<p class="class_paragraph">  With our welcome song, we warmly receive you and your ward to the Cr√®che department. Here we endeavour to give your ward the foundation (s)he would need for self-discovery, self-expression and later academic growth. 
				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">

				This foundation includes skills for communication in English language and numeracy. Learning tools and activities are used to help children develop good eye and hand co-ordination, fine motor skills and finger gifts for writing. 
				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">
				At the end of this programme pupils should have a grisps of letters A to G, numbers 1 - 10, and be able to identify primary colours.Also, they would have better concentration, developed their finger gifts, would be able to make basic communication and would attempt eating on their own.
					</p>

					In this department we endeavour to continue the task of self-discovery, self-expressions started in creche.

				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">
					 In Nursery One (1) Children we will to further improve their Literacy; English language and Numeracy skills and their ability to engage in basic conversations with people around them. They learn about themselves, the environment and how to properly treat things that constitute it. Hence, it is not strange to find these Children engage in conversations and debates about the weather. They are also entreated to be courteous towards others. Also, their ability to focus and memorize is improved.

				<p class="class_paragraph">
				When they are ready to go to Kindergarten, we hope to have accomplished the ability to identity all letters of the English Alphabet, know and say numbers 1-50 confidently and know and recite a few poems and rhymes.

				<h3 class="class_paragraph">Kindergarten</h3>

					<p class="class_paragraph">
						<strong>Ages:</strong> 4 - 6 years
					</p>
					<p class="class_paragraph">
						<strong>Keyword:</strong> Kind
					</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph"> The main purpose of Kindergarten is to mould the child's social character thorough activities and instilling self discipline. In our Montessori setting we adhere to the former while we allow room for children to explore and develop their personalities and skills at their own pace. This allows values picked up at this stage to be deeply entrenched in them; difficult to erase and easy to build upon.

				<p class="class_paragraph">
					We have two classes of small class sizes to enable adequate interaction between facilitators and children. 
				
				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">
					With respect to the traditional expectations, children are taught arithmetic and their knowledge and use of English vocabulary improved.They can identify and write numbers from 1- 100, can do addition and subtraction of single and double digit numbers, can write lower and upper case letters and can read basic sentences in English.
				
				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">
				At the end of the programme, kids would be able to read basic English sentences fluently while observing the various punctuation marks, practice good courtesy, morally express acts of kindness and gratitude towards others. And most importantly be able to interact with their peers and the elderly appropriately.
					</p>




				<h3 class="class_paragraph">Basic</h3>
				<p class="class_paragraph"> 
						<img src="img/final_selection/programmes/primary1.JPG" alt="These are the kids" class="schoolone"/> 
						
						<p>
						<strong>Ages:</strong> 6 - 12 years
					</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph"> 
					Upon reaching the next level of their education, children are expected to be able to communicate with themselves adequately and make simple calculations involving addition and subtraction. They should also exhibit good interpersonal and personal relationships among the peers and others.

				<p class="class_paragraph">
					Therefore, it is the mandate of the Basic school education to build upon the solid foundation laid in pre-school. 
				
				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">
					During this stage of their education, children are guided along the path of discovery by a facilitator. They are encouraged to be inquisitive and their questions answered appropriately. Also, the facilitators provide conditions to help improve their reading of complex sentences with understanding and calculations involving number of three or more digits. 
				
				</p>

				<p class="class_paragraph">
				At this stage of their life, children are extremely hyperactive. Instead of coiling this up, we will use this an asset and regulate it through the token economy reward system whiles breaks are held at intervals to prevent them burning out.

						With our vision in sight, our mission at hand and our motto ‚Äúdiligence and excellence‚Äù we plan to advance to include Upper Primary, Junior High School (JHS) and College in the near future. Already, facilities for our Upper primary are in place and awaiting students and we graciously announce to you that admissions are opened. 
				</p>
				<p class="class_paragraph">
						However, plans are underway to acquire a new site for our Junior High and College complex.
				</p>
				<p class="class_paragraph">
						With these structures in place, our wards would be able to smoothly graduate to the next level of educational while they are groomed and prepared for educational opportunities both home and abroad. In light of this, we are working towards receiving accreditation from the requisite bodies and boards related higher learning both home and abroad. 
				</p>

				<h3 class="class_paragraph">Clubs and societies</h3>
				<p class="class_paragraph "> 
						Knowing our pledge for holistic development, we endeavour to introduce the appropriate clubs and societies. These would provide our young ones an avenue to develop skills and talents and better prepare them for life outside our school walls. An exchange programme would run alongside giving our wards the opportunity to appreciate life in different parts of the world with varying cultures and customs.
